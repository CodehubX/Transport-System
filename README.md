# Logistics Managment System

This respository contains code to a logistics managment system written in Vissual basic, the program contains multiple cruitial components that make this solution viable, for example, the user has to enter an activation code before he/she can use the software. The software enables its users to receive orders, available transpsorters and it allows the users to book the transport based on the order received. There are two profiles which is the transporter profile and the logistics agency profile, therefore this platform acts as a passage for the two parties to secure deals effecieintly.

## Getting Started

This project was built with a mysql connector so therefore before attempting to run the softwrae enstall themysql connector which i have placed in the respository and also asjust the database connection string to match your personel database. One should have knowllege in the following areas:

```
MySQL
Vissual Basic
Relational Database UML design
Some knowllege on how logistics work
```
 

### Prerequisites

This project was written in vissual basic so it should not be that hard for a beginer to pick up, however i do recommend taking a refresher course in programming before attempting to mdify the software.


### Running Logistics System

1. Install the mysql connector onto your computer
2. Create a database following the same data required in the code
3. Download and install Visual Studio comunity version and open the project
4. Click run and the solution should startup

* if any problems occur its probably because of the mysql connector, so yould need to do alittle research on installing the mysql connector effeciently, however make sure to use the version of mysql connector that i have placed in the respository.
